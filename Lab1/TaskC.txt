1. Are h1 and h2 admissible?
    Yes. Neither h1 or h2 overestimates the cost h(s) compared to the actual cost g(s).
2. Which heuristic among h1 and h2 performs better, and why?
    h2 performs better because it provides more accurate information about the distance to the solution.
3. Which of the heuristics h3, h4, and h5 are admissible?
    -h3: Is admissible since h1 is always <= h2. If h1 = h2 then h3 = (h2 + h2)/2 = h2 which is admissible
    -h4: Is not admissible. E.g. if one tile is misplaced the result of h4 is 2.
    -h5: Is admissible since it takes the max value of two admissible heuristics
