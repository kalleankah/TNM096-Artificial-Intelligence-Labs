1. Are h1 and h2 admissible?
    Yes. Neither h1 or h2 overestimates the cost h(s) compared to the actual cost g(s).    
    h2 calculates the number of steps
2. Which heuristic among h1 and h2 performs better, and why?
    h2 performs better because it provides more accurate information about the distance to the solution.
3. Which of the heuristics h3, h4, and h5 are admissible?
    -h3: Is admissible since h1 is always <= h2. If h1 = h2 then h3 = (h2 + h2)/2 = h2 which is admissible
    -h4: Is not admissible. E.g. if one tile is misplaced the result of h4 is 2.
    -h5: Is admissible since it takes the max value of two admissible heuristics

For h1:
- You can only correct one misplaced tile at a time, two tiles can not swap places.
- h1 gives any misplaced tile the value 1, which is never higher than the cost of fixing it.

For h2:
- You can still only correct one misplaced tile at a time.
- You can only correct its level of misplacement by 1 per move.
- h2 measures the manhattan distance, which is never longer than the actual distance since it follows the same rules as the game.
- A tile that is misplaced with a measured distance of D will always need at least D moves to be placed correctly.

c is the actual cost
h1 and h2 are admissable, proved in 1.
h1 <= c
h2 <= c
h1+h2 <= 2c
(h1+h2)/2 <= c
